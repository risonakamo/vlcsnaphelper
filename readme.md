### in-case i lose my memory
- <span style="font-size: 30px">**make sure screenshots are the right format**. that format is: <span style="font-size: 100px">$T_$N_</span></span>
- download it into a folder called app and use it with electron
- make sure the stuff in **imagecontrol.js** is set right or things will break
- make sure your vlc snap directory and keep directory are **empty** or **you will be confused**
- recommended vlc key settings:
    - S: screenshot
    - V: subtitle
    - shift+arrows: 3s seek
    - alt+arrows: 10s seek
    - ctrl+arrows: 1min seek
    - ctrl+alt+arrows: 5min seek
